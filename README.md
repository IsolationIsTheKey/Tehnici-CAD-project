• The project involves using an 8051 microcontroller to monitor and control temperature through an LCD display.
• Key components include a temperature sensor (LM35), an analog-to-digital converter (ADC0808), and a differential amplifier to
enhance resolution.
• The system allows users to adjust temperature settings and controls the activation of a central heating unit based on the
current and desired temperatures.
• The implementation includes writing code in C51 for functions such as temperature conversion, LCD display control, and realtime interaction with hardware components.
• The application used for development and simulation was Keil uVision.
